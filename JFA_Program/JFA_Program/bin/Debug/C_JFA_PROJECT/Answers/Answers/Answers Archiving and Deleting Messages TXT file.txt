If you archive a message, it's moved to All Mail (your archive), where you can easily find it in the future, using Google's powerful search feature. Since you have plenty of space for storing all your mail (25 Gb), we recommend that you archive messages rather than permanently deleting them., "Archiving and Deleting Messages"
